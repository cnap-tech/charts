Piraeus (LINSTOR) storage has been deployed.

Resources created by subcharts:
  - LinstorCluster (piraeus operator deploys controller + satellites)
  - LinstorSatelliteConfiguration (file-backed thin pool)
  - StorageClass (default storage class for workloads)

It may take a few minutes for the operator to become fully ready.
